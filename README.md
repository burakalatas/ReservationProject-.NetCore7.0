# ReservationProject-.NetCore7.0
In this project I am going to create a reservation website.

I used some technologies in this project:
- n-tier architecture
- Entity framework
- .Net Core 7.0
- Fluent Validation
- Asp.NetCore Identity
- MSSQL (Code First Approach)
- Serilog
- ClosedXml & EpPlus For Excel Outputs
- iTextSharp For Pdf Outputs
- MailKit has been added to send mails to users via system. (Not active right now. Because of there is no any sender mail.)
- Auto Mapper
- Rapid Api
- CQRS Design pattern (it isn't included to all project. Only small part.)
- MediatR has been added to ease the connection of CQRS folders.
- Unit of work implementation has been added the small part of project.
